<p>Jayne's Banana Stand has watched a lot of changes in its 24years existence. Our only change has been to add a website. Specializing in Filipino fruits Jayne's Banana Stand has been a tourist destination for over 20 years.</p>

<p>We are located in San Dimas on W Allen Avenue. What used to be horse properties and farmland is now a mixture of the horse properties on one side and businesses and business parks on the other. It is usually really easy to find us, just look for the parked tour buses!</p>
