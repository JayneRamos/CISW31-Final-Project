This updated website template is based on chapter 5 of our text book. 

Any changes to the header are made in the header.php file. This section creates all of the opening tags for HTML5. 
Mets tags, css property links and JavaScripts are declared and defined in this section.

Any changes to the footer are made in the footer.php file. All of the closing tags to HTML5 are created in this section.

All other pages created for this website template must be .php format. Don't create additional HTML5 pages with
<!-<html></html>, <head></head> or <body></body>  --!> tags. They are generated automatically for each page by the header.php
and footer.php files. All other tags and classes can be used in this section. This page uses the /* <?php and ?> tags */.

Styling, unless specific to that one instance should be made to main.css.
